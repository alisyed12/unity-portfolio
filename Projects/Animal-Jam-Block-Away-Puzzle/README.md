# 🧩 Animal Jam – Block Away Puzzle

An engaging **infinite-level puzzle game** where players must clear the board by moving colored blocks toward their matching gates.  
Each block moves only in its assigned direction, and when it collides with its identical gate at the board’s edge — it disappears!  
The game dynamically generates new puzzles, shapes, and layouts, ensuring endless replayability.

## 🎮 Gameplay Overview
- **Objective:** Clear all blocks on the board by matching them with their corresponding gates.  
- **Movement Rules:**
  - Blocks move **vertically**, **horizontally**, or **freely**, depending on their assigned movement type.  
  - Each move must be planned strategically to avoid deadlocks.  
- **Procedural Generation:**
  - All elements — blocks, gates, colors, and placements — are **spawned dynamically at runtime**.  
  - Level difficulty and grid size **increase progressively** as the player advances.  
- **Infinite Levels:** No predefined stages; the game continuously generates new puzzles.
